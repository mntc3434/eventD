Event-Driven Programming Example

Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of event-driven programming using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The application includes a button that moves to a random position within the window whenever the user hovers over it. This is achieved using an event handler that listens for the MouseEnter event and dynamically updates the button's position.
